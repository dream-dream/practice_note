there are some face-value of cash,when someone give you a number you got the best way to give the change back
li = [100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1] # face-value of cash


def change(arg):
    finally_l = []
    for cash in li:
        divisor, remainder = divmod(arg, cash)
        if remainder > 0:
            arg = remainder
        finally_l.append(divisor)
    finally_l.reverse()
    return finally_l


ret = change(78)
print(ret)
